## Payment Module PRD

Overview:
The Payment Module must be implemented soon and should support refunds as needed. 
The module will be optional for the v1 release but required for production. 
The billing deadline is TBD. Acceptance criteria are still not defined.

Scope:
- Support credit card payments and bank transfer.
- Refunds: process refunds as needed within a reasonable time.
- Integration: Alice will handle integration with the payment gateway.

Requirements:
1. The system should optimize transactions for speed.
2. Payment retries will be optional and handled later.
3. For compliance, encryption must be implemented.

Notes:
The word "soon" and "as needed" are vague. This document also contains a conflict 
between optional and required behavior. Owners are partially specified. 
No acceptance criteria are provided.
